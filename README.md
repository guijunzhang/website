## Guijun Zhang Website
Personal website to display achievements, skills, and hobbies.

## Motivation
I intended to create a personal website that will demonstrate my skills and interests. I was also very interested in learning how to make a website. With these goals in mind, I decided to make this website to honor my achievements and display my hobbies and skills. This to me will help with job seeking, which is my primary goal as a high school junior under quarantine.

## Code Style 
I primarily refer to Google's Java Style Guide for Java codes and PEP 8 for Python codes.
